# customer_satisfaction_prediction
In this project, we have to make exploratory data analysis on the dataset
and also create a machine learning learning model to find out the customer satisfaction

The dataset consists of customer, sellers, purchase, delivery and survey of customer response

Using this datasets, I've make insights in the dataset which effects the data more.

Logistic regression is used in this project, the labelled data feature is of bivariate.
For bivariate analysis, logistics suits the best

# Tools used in this project are:
Python
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
sklearn
machine learning
flask

The machine learning is deployed in the given link( https://customer-satisfaction-pred.herokuapp.com/ )
